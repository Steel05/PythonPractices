Random Number Guesser - Create a program that allows the user to input a number than have the computer guess random numbers until it gets the number the user gave, have the
			computer keep track of how many guesses it made and state number after it has guessed the number
[CHALLENGE] - Add code onto this project that will create a random range for the computer to guess in, the range must be from 0 to no more than twice the target number
[CHALLENGE] - Add code onto this project that will keep track of the highest and lowest number the computer guessed and print it at the end
[CHALLENGE] - Add code onto this project that will prevent the computer from guessing the same number twice



Higher or Lower - Create a program that will generate a random number then have the user attempt to guess the number, after every guess inform the user if the target number
		  is higher or lower than their guess, upon guessing the number inform the user how many times they had to guess in order to get the number



Number Wordle - Create a program that will generate a random 3 digit code then have the user try to guess the code, after each guess inform the if each digit of their guess
		is in the correct spot, in the wrong spot, or not in the code at all
[EVOLVE] - Wordle - Modify the code of this project to work with letters instead of numbers and have it function like the game Wordle



Random Square - Create a program using SimpleGUI that will draw a square to the screen and will move to a random position when a button is pressed
[CHALLENGE] - Add code onto this project that will change the size of the square randomly when the button is pressed
[CHALLENGE] - Add code onto this project to also move the square to where the user clicks without changing its size



Moving Square - Create a program using SimpleGUI that will allow the user to control a square on the screen by moving it when the user presses one of the arrow keys
[CHALLENGE] - Add code onto this project that will continously move the square if the user holds down the arrow keys



Robot - Create a program that will allow the user to input commands to move a robot on a coordinate plane in all four cardinal directions, the commands should follow this
	format: [DIRECTION] [DISTANCE] Ex. Up 5, then have the program print the new position of the robot after every command
